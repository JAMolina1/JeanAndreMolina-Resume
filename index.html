        <p class="lead mb-4">Greetings, I am Jean Andre Molina and currently residing at the University of California, Riverside. Presently, I am a first-year with sophomore standing and in the Pre-Business Program. I am a first-generation college immigrant student from the Island Nations Philippines. I am Bilingual in English and Tagalog. Furthermore, I have 3 years of experience in speaking Spanish. At the same time, I am currently learning Korean. Other than my linguistic skills, I am very adept in strategic planning and very accurate detailed.
<br><br>

        I am a Detail-oriented Records Specialist adept at coordinating digital and physical records for minutes purposes. Also, I am highly organized and hard working with a clear focus on maintaining efficient and accurate operations. My professional experience ranged from club activities in high school to internships. In Etiwanda High School, I became an officer in several volunteering and academic clubs. Within the year of 2018 to 2019, I was the AP Statistics Club Financial Officer. I performed various administrative functions, including filing paperwork, delivering mail, sorting mail, office cleaning and bookkeeping. Furthermore, I provided both internal and external communication for the clubâ€™s financial position and information and the necessary required financial documents to both the school and fundraiser. Within that same year, I was the Model United Nations Club Secretary. I Maintained daily reports and advised executive leaders in decision-making processes and delivered top-notch administrative support to staff, promoting excellence in all areas of office operations. In Addition, I prepared and distributed team-based communications to foster collaboration and enhance club officersâ€™ morale. Furthermore, I developed record-keeping systems for club documents to optimize clubs operations and enhance fundraising approval by the school administration. Lastly, I transcribed and organized information to assist in preparing speeches and presentations.In high school, I was the Co-teacher for the AP Biology and Honors Biology Classes. During that time, I gave lectures and offered help to the students in topics ranging from microbiology to the ecosystem. As the co-teacher, I also led the AP Biology Club which offeres tutoring and fundraises for the memberâ€™s AP tests.
<br><br>

        Other than Club Activies, I have internship experience specifically at Gladstone Care & Rehabilitation Center in Glendora California. I was the Office Clerk during that time. Also I maintained organized files and stocked supplies to support team needs and maximize performance. Moreover, I checked documentation for accuracy and validity on updated systems
Finally, I provided clerical support to 626-963-5955 company employees by copying, faxing and filing documents.Currently, I am involved in Korean Pop-Cultural(KPOP) Club and participates in the various KPOP dances ranging from EXO to BTS. Through dancing, I am able to lead a team of dancers. My role in the group was to teach everyone the choreography in a short limited amount of time since we were all busy with academics. Before teaching the dance steps, I had to teach the whole choreography by myself by watching various tutorials on youtube. Once I was able to master the steps, I started teaching my fellow dancers the first couple of steps on our first day of practice.
